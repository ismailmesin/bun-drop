## Bun-Drop
This project is named Bun-Drop and and it is a react app with a json server created for a company that make Burgers on order then deliveres them to you with the help of drones.

The app is built like a dynamic E-commerce app with a home-page, menu ,shopping-cart and payment details. In the app you can add and remove items from the shopping cart and then procceed to the payment methods.

## Getting started
to get this project up and running we first need to download some packages 

### `npm install react-router-dom`
this is the first package you will need to download, in the terminal you can just type the same command that i wrote.

### `npm install phosphor-react`
in this project i have used some icons from a package called phosphor so you will need to install that aswell.

### scripts
to get the app started we will need to run the first two scripts in the Available Scripts section

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run json-server`
this script will set up the json server on the URL: (http://localhost:9000)
you will need this as all of the data is on the json-server

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
